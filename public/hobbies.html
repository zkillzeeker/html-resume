    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
  
    <h2>Playing Guitar</h2>
    <p>Playing the guitar is one of my greatest passions. I enjoy strumming chords and learning new songs. It's a creative outlet that brings me joy and relaxation.</p>
  
    <h2>DIY Welding</h2>
    <p>I have a small welding setup at home where I work on various DIY projects. It's fulfilling to see my ideas come to life as I fabricate and weld metal pieces together.</p>
  
    <h2>Gardening</h2>
    <p>Gardening is a wonderful way to connect with nature. I cultivate different plants, including strawberries, mulberry, pechay, onion, spring onions, kangkong, and more. It's rewarding to see them grow and enjoy the fresh produce from my garden.</p>
  
    <h2>Hiking</h2>
    <p>Exploring hiking trails within the city allows me to escape the urban hustle and immerse myself in nature. I enjoy the peacefulness and the breathtaking views along the trails. It's a great way to stay active and appreciate the beauty around us.</p>
  
    <h2>Motorcycling</h2>
    <p>Motorcycling is my adventurous side unleashed. Riding on two wheels provides an exhilarating experience as I explore new places, feel the freedom of the open road, and connect with fellow riders. It's an adrenaline rush like no other.</p>
